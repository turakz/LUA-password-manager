# LUA-password-manager

exercise taken from Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart:
  simple but INSECURE password manager

use:
-create a file that stores account, password pairs (i've uploaded an example *.txt)

-call lua program with an account as an argument
-password will be copied to system clipboard (WINDOWS OS only)

*filename will have to be edited in source so that the program knows where the account, password pairs are located
